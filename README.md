# House-price-prediction
Dataset: more than 20,000 housing prices in Norway and their corresponding factors, such as: year of built, location, income of area, size, number of floors... 

Technique: apply various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, XgBoost and neural networks to the dataset to analyze the performance of each algorithm.

Time series forecasting model

The research questions are:
[1] What is the best machine learning algorithms to predict house prices in Norway?
[2] How is the movement of Norwegian houses price in the next 5 years?
